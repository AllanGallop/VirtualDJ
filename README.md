# VirtualDJ
WIP: A browser based music player with visualiser for my wedding based on websockets and Python Flask

### Preface
We are opting not to have a DJ or Band for our wedding reception as I already own decent audio and lighting gear,
so I wanted simple application to run through a playlist and show some fancy visualisations. This is still very much
a **Work-in-Progress** hobby project for local use! *only a fool would host this online*

### Usage
* Copying files into /media
* Add items to playlist.json file
* Start webserver.py
* Navigate browser (usually ```http\\:localhost:5000``` )
